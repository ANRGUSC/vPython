Verifiable Python (vPython)
====================================
This repository maintains the source code of verifiable Python, which extends the source code of Python-3.9. In particular, this version expands the Python runtime to gather runtime statistics while the software is being executed. We will continue to update the repository. To learn about the ongoing work that applies vPython for fake news detection, please refer to the documents folder.
